# ƒenster

A small, lightweight window server and UI toolkit designed for easy embedding and minimal dependencies.

This work-in-progress project aims to provide a clean, self-contained system for powering graphical environments — from hobby operating systems to embedded or experimental platforms.

It originated as part of the [Ghost OS](https://github.com/maxdev1/ghost) project, a hobby operating system.
